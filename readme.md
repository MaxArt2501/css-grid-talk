CSS Grid talk
=============

Slides for a talk about [CSS Grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).
64 slides, about 40 minutes. In Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ - sorry folks, English translation is coming (maybe).

Originally held at the [2017 CSS Day](http://2017.cssday.it/talks.html#Massimo-Artizzu) in Faenza, 2017-03-17.

Built on top of [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), PostCSS, Gulp.

## Building

Node.js 6.x is required (actually it could work in Node 4 - haven't checked). Also this presentation has been
developed and tested in Chrome only.

1. Clone the repository (it weighs 24 MB with images and all, so be careful on mobile connections);
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build` (or just `gulp` if you have it installed globally);
4. Open `public/index.html` in Chrome

If you want to see the speaker's notes, you have to serve the directory `public` with a HTTP server.


## Tests

... what?
